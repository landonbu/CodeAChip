# CodeAChip

This notebook is being created as a submission to the IEEE SSCS Code-a-Chip Grant Award competition. The aim is to have this submission ready by the **15 April 2024** deadline. 

The goal of this notebook is to walk users through creating their own image sensor array. 

If time permits, users may be able to select their own components to tile into an image sensor array. 

If time allows, structures will be put into place to allow for on-chip motion detection, referencing [this paper by Choo et al. ](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8662306) 

Work is in progress.
